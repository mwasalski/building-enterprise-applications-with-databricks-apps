# MAGIC # LAB - Developing Databricks Apps with Local IDE

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ## Lab Scenario
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In this lab, you'll transition to using an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for updating your Databricks application. While previous tasks could be accomplished using Databricks Notebooks, adopting an IDE facilitates a more robust development workflow, aligning with best practices for production-grade applications.

# MAGIC ## Lab Tasks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC * Access and prepare your IDE environment
# MAGIC * Develop the app in a project folder within your IDE
# MAGIC * Run and test the app locally
# MAGIC * Deploy the app to Databricks
# MAGIC
# MAGIC **📌 Note:** This lab uses the app from the previous lab. Thus, you will need to complete the previous lab before completing this one.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC ### Task 1: Set Up the IDE and Databricks CLI
# MAGIC
# MAGIC In your IDE environment, set up a workspace. Create a Python virtual environment, and install and configure the Databricks CLI.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 2: Develop the app
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Set up a project folder and populate it with code from the previous lab.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 3: Run and test app locally
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Run the app and access it. If time permits, set up and use the source-level debugging capabilities of your IDE.

# COMMAND ----------

# MAGIC %md
# MAGIC ### Task 4: Deploy and Monitor the Application
# MAGIC
# MAGIC Deploy the updated application to Databricks using the Databricks CLI. Monitor the deployment logs for any issues, and access the application via its URL to confirm that the new changes have been successfully implemented.
# MAGIC
# MAGIC > **🚨 Important:** Do not delete this application! It will be utilized in the subsequent lab.
